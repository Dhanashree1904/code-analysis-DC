    "analysis": "## Malware Code Analysis of demo1.py\n\nThis Python script is a *safe demo* designed to mimic the behavior of malicious code for analysis purposes.  It does not perform any harmful actions itself but demonstrates techniques commonly used in malware.\n\n**1. Purpose:**\n\nThe code simulates various malware behaviors, including anti-VM checks, persistence mechanism setup, network communication attempts, and data collection.  It's intended for educational purposes to illustrate how malware operates, not to be malicious itself.\n\n**2. Suspicious/Malicious Lines/Functions (with Reasoning):**\n\n* **Lines 21-23:**  The use of `base64` encoding for `ENCODED_C2` and `ENCODED_CMD` is a common obfuscation technique. While the decoded values are harmless placeholders, in real malware, these would likely contain command-and-control (C2) server addresses or malicious commands.\n* **Lines 37-40:** `anti_vm_check()` function simulates an anti-VM check.  Real malware often includes these checks to avoid detection in virtualized environments used for analysis.  The `suspicious_markers` list is a simple example; real malware may employ more sophisticated techniques.\n* **Lines 46-59:** `setup_persistence_demo()` mimics persistence.  The commented-out code (lines 54-57) shows how real malware might add registry keys to achieve persistence.  The script's commented-out example uses the Windows registry which is a common persistence technique.  The file write to a `.persistence_demo.txt` is a harmless stand-in.\n* **Lines 63-80:** `connect_c2_demo()` simulates connecting to a C2 server.  While the actual connection is commented out, the code structure shows how a socket would be used to communicate with a remote server.  The extraction of the `host` and `port` from a potentially obfuscated string is a typical malware pattern.\n* **Lines 84-91:**  `collect_data_demo()` gathers system information (`cwd`, `pid`, `platform`).  Malicious code could easily extend this to collect sensitive data like credentials or files.\n\n\n**3. Malware Behavior Coding Patterns:**\n\n* **Obfuscation:** Base64 encoding of strings (lines 21-23).\n* **Anti-VM/Anti-Analysis:** Check for virtualization software (lines 37-40).\n* **Persistence:** Simulates registry key manipulation for persistence (lines 54-57, albeit commented out).\n* **Network Communication:** Sets up a socket for communication with a remote server (lines 63-80, albeit commented out).\n* **Data Collection:** Collects system information that could be used for reconnaissance or exfiltration (lines 84-91).\n\n**4. External Libraries/APIs/System Calls:**\n\n* `os`: Used for getting current working directory (`os.getcwd()`) and process ID (`os.getpid()`).  These are standard system calls but could be used for malicious purposes to determine system context.\n* `sys`: Accesses system-specific parameters and functions, allowing potential manipulation of the environment.\n* `base64`: Used for encoding/decoding strings, a common obfuscation technique.\n* `socket`: Used for creating a network socketâ€”a key component of malware's C2 communication.\n* `platform`: Gathers system information.  Potentially used for reconnaissance or tailoring behavior to the victim's system.\n* `pathlib`: Manipulates file paths, which could be used for file operations.  In this case, it creates a harmless placeholder file.\n\n\n**5. File System Operations:**\n\nYes, the `setup_persistence_demo()` function (lines 46-59) writes a harmless placeholder file to the current directory.  The commented-out code suggests potential registry key manipulation (which would be a file system operation).\n\n**6. Network-Related Code:**\n\nYes, the `connect_c2_demo()` function (lines 63-80) demonstrates the creation of a socket and the parsing of a host and port.  Though the connection is not executed, the code shows the potential for network communication.  The `ENCODED_C2` variable points to a hardcoded URL.\n\n**7. Process/Service Manipulation:**\n\nNo direct process or service manipulation.  However, the commented-out registry code in `setup_persistence_demo()` hints at the potential for creating a persistent process through a registry run key.\n\n**8. System Resource Interaction:**\n\nThe commented-out registry manipulation in `setup_persistence_demo()` would interact with the Windows registry, a common target for malware.  The code also gathers system information.\n\n**9. Obfuscation/Evasion Techniques:**\n\nBase64 encoding of strings (`ENCODED_C2`, `ENCODED_CMD`).  The anti-VM check is a basic form of anti-analysis.\n\n**10. Data Collection/Exfiltration:**\n\nThe `collect_data_demo()` function collects basic system information.  This is a precursor to more advanced data collection;  malware might extend this to steal sensitive information.\n\n**11. Incomplete/Obfuscated/Misleading Parts:**\n\nThe commented-out code sections in `setup_persistence_demo()` and `connect_c2_demo()` are intentionally incomplete.  They demonstrate how similar code could be used maliciously.\n\n\n**12. MITRE ATT&CK Techniques:**\n\n* **T1047.001 (Obfuscation - Software packing/compression):** The base64 encoding obfuscates strings.\n* **T1070.001 (Indicator Removal on Host - File deletion):** While not explicitly present, the potential for file deletion (though not implemented here) is implied by malware persistence methods.\n* **T1071.001 (Command and Control - External C2):** The code structure shows potential for connecting to a remote C2 server.\n* **T1543.003 (Execute External Program):** The execution of `ping` as shown in the commented-out code is implied.\n* **T1547.001 (System Information Discovery):** The script collects system information (OS, PID, current directory).\n* **T1547.002 (System Network Configuration Discovery):** The script attempts to connect to a host:port, demonstrating system network discovery.\n\n\n**13. Overall Risk Rating:**\n\n**Low**. The code itself is harmless. However, it demonstrates techniques used by high-risk malware.\n\n**14. Analyst Recommendations:**\n\n* **Dynamic Analysis:** Execute the code in a sandboxed environment to observe its behavior.\n* **Behavioral Analysis:** Monitor network connections and file system operations during execution.\n* **YARA Rules:** Create YARA rules to detect the patterns used in this demo (e.g., base64-encoded strings, specific function calls).\n* **Static Analysis:** Thoroughly review the code for obfuscation and other suspicious code patterns, and look for indicators of malicious behavior.\n\n\n**15. Unintelligible Parts:**\n\nNo parts of the code are unintelligible.  The comments clearly explain the intent of each section.\n\n**16. Brief Summary in Points:**\n\n* Safe demo mimicking malware techniques.\n* Uses base64 encoding for obfuscation.\n* Simulates anti-VM checks, persistence, network communication, and data collection.\n* Contains commented-out code demonstrating malicious actions (registry manipulation, network connection).\n* Does not perform any harmful actions itself.\n* Useful for static malware analysis training.\n\n"

    "analysis": "## Malware Code Analysis of demo2.ps1\n\nThis PowerShell script, despite its claim of being a \"SAFE DEMO,\" exhibits several characteristics that would raise concerns in a real-world malware analysis scenario.  The script is designed to mimic malicious behaviors without actually performing them. This makes static analysis crucial to understand its potential.\n\n1. **Purpose:** The code simulates various malware functionalities, including anti-VM checks, persistence mechanism demonstration, and network communication setup, all without actually executing the harmful actions.  It's designed for educational purposes or testing of malware detection tools.\n\n\n2. **Suspicious/Malicious Lines/Functions:**\n\n* **Lines 6-8:** Base64 encoding/decoding of a URL. While not inherently malicious, this is a common obfuscation technique used to hide command and control (C2) server addresses.\n* **Lines 10-16: `Get-AntiVM` function:** This function checks for common virtual machine (VM) processes.  While harmless in this context, this is a typical anti-analysis technique used by malware to avoid detection in sandbox environments.\n* **Lines 18-23: `Set-PersistenceDemo` function:** This function *demonstrates* how to add a registry key for persistence but is thankfully commented out.  If uncommented, it would add a run key, allowing the malware to automatically execute on system startup.  This is a classic persistence mechanism.\n* **Lines 25-33: `Invoke-NetworkDemo` function:**  This function parses a decoded URL but does *not* actually establish a network connection. However, the construction of the network request and the use of a hardcoded URL raise suspicion.\n\n3. **Malware Behavior Coding Patterns:**\n\n* **Anti-VM check:** The `Get-AntiVM` function demonstrates anti-analysis behavior.\n* **Persistence mechanism (commented out):** The `Set-PersistenceDemo` function shows a clear attempt to establish persistence through registry manipulation.\n* **Network communication setup:** The `Invoke-NetworkDemo` function simulates preparation for network communication with a hardcoded URL.\n\n\n4. **External Libraries, APIs, and System Calls:**\n\n* **`[Convert]::ToBase64String`, `[Convert]::FromBase64String`:**  Used for encoding/decoding, commonly employed for obfuscation.\n* **`[Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes`, `[Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetString`:** Standard text encoding/decoding.\n* **`Get-Process`:** Accesses system process information, potentially used for process enumeration or identifying running security tools.\n* **`reg add` (commented out):**  Direct registry manipulation, a common technique for persistence.\n* **`Out-File`:** Writes to the file system; could be used for logging or creating artifacts.\n\n\n5. **File System Operations:**\n\n* Yes. `Out-File` is used to create a file (`.persistence_demo.txt`), although it's within the script directory, making it less harmful than writing to system directories.\n\n6. **Network-Related Code:**\n\n* Yes. The script contains a hardcoded URL (\"http://example.com:8080/heartbeat\") and simulates the parsing of a URI, indicating potential for network communication (although no actual connection is made).\n\n7. **Process/Service Manipulation:**\n\n* No. No actual process creation or service manipulation is done.  However, the commented-out `reg add` command shows an intention to interact with system startup services.\n\n8. **System Resource Interaction:**\n\n* Yes (commented out). The `Set-PersistenceDemo` function attempts to interact with the registry (HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run).\n\n9. **Obfuscation/Evasion:**\n\n* Yes. Base64 encoding of the URL is a basic form of obfuscation.  The commented-out persistence mechanism also acts as a form of obfuscation by hiding the intended malicious activity.\n\n10. **Data Collection/Exfiltration:**\n\n* No. The code does not collect or exfiltrate any data.\n\n11. **Incomplete/Obfuscated/Misleading Parts:**\n\n* The commented-out `Set-PersistenceDemo` function is the most significant example, misleadingly showing intent without actually performing the action.  The \"SAFE DEMO\" comment is also a potentially misleading indicator.\n\n12. **MITRE ATT&CK Techniques:**\n\n* **T1070.001 (Indicator Removal on Host):**  The `Get-AntiVM` function is a basic example of trying to identify if the malware is running within a virtual machine or sandbox, a common indicator removal method.\n* **T1547.001 (Boot or Logon Autostart Execution):** The commented-out registry key addition demonstrates the intent to establish persistence using the autostart execution mechanism.\n* **T1041 (External Remote Services):** The handling of the URL demonstrates the intent to use external remote services, which is often used in command and control infrastructure (though this script doesn't actually connect to anything).\n\n\n13. **Overall Risk Rating:** Low (as provided).  *However, if the commented-out code were uncommented and executed, the rating would increase significantly to High.*\n\n14. **Analyst Recommendations:**\n\n* **Static analysis:** Review the code thoroughly, as this example demonstrates.\n* **Dynamic analysis (in a sandboxed environment):**  Run the script in a controlled environment to observe its behavior if the comments were removed.\n* **YARA rules:** Develop YARA rules to detect similar code patterns and obfuscation techniques.\n* **Detection strategies:** Implement security controls to detect attempts at registry key creation and unusual network connections.\n\n15. **Unintelligible Parts:** No.\n\n16. **Summary in Points:**\n\n* Demo script simulating malware behaviors.\n* Uses base64 encoding for obfuscation.\n* Includes anti-VM checks.\n* Demonstrates (commented-out) persistence via registry manipulation.\n* Simulates network communication setup.\n* Low risk as presented; high risk if the commented code were enabled.\n* Mimics several MITRE ATT&CK techniques.\n\n"
