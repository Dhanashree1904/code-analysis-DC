    "analysis": "## Malware Code Analysis of demo1.py\n\nThis Python script is a *safe demo* designed to mimic the structure and techniques of malicious code for analysis practice.  It does not perform any harmful actions. However, let's analyze it as if it were malicious.\n\n\n1. **Purpose:** The code simulates various stages of a malware lifecycle, including anti-VM checks, persistence mechanism establishment, network communication with a command-and-control (C2) server, and data collection.\n\n\n2. **Suspicious/Malicious Lines/Functions:**\n\n* **Lines 17-18:**  The `ENCODED_C2` and `ENCODED_CMD` variables store base64-encoded strings.  While harmless placeholders in this demo, real malware would use this to hide C2 server addresses or malicious commands.\n* **Lines 22-24:** The `decode_strings()` function decodes these strings.  This is a common obfuscation technique.\n* **Lines 28-36:** The `anti_vm_check()` function checks for virtualization software.  Malware uses this to avoid detection in sandboxed environments.\n* **Lines 38-52:** The `setup_persistence_demo()` function *simulates* persistence by writing to a temporary file.  Real malware would add registry keys (commented-out example on line 48), scheduled tasks, or modify startup scripts.  **Line 48 is particularly suspicious**, as it shows an attempt to add a Run key to the Windows registry, a classic persistence technique.\n* **Lines 54-71:** The `connect_c2_demo()` function *simulates* connecting to a C2 server.  The commented-out socket connection (lines 65-67) is the key point.  In real malware, this would establish a connection to a malicious server.\n* **Lines 73-81:** The `collect_data_demo()` function collects system information (cwd, PID, platform). While seemingly benign here, in real malware, this could be expanded to collect sensitive data (credentials, files, etc.).\n\n\n3. **Malware Behavior Patterns:**\n\n* **Obfuscation:** Base64 encoding of strings (lines 17-18).\n* **Anti-VM/Anti-Analysis:** Check for virtualization software (lines 28-36).\n* **Persistence:** Simulated persistence mechanism (lines 38-52), with a commented-out example of a real persistence technique.\n* **Network Communication:** Simulated connection to a C2 server (lines 54-71).\n* **Data Collection:** Collection of system information (lines 73-81).\n\n\n4. **External Libraries/APIs/System Calls:**\n\n* `os`: Used for getting current working directory (`getcwd`) and process ID (`getpid`).  Potentially used for file system manipulation in malicious code.\n* `sys`:  Generally used for system-level interactions.  Could be exploited in malware for various purposes.\n* `base64`: Used for encoding/decoding strings (obfuscation).\n* `socket`: Used for network communication (simulated here).\n* `platform`: Used to gather system information (potentially for fingerprinting and targeting).\n* `pathlib`: Used for file path manipulation (simulated persistence).\n* `winreg` (commented out):  Used for registry manipulation (persistence).  This is a highly suspicious import if uncommented.\n\n\n5. **File System Operations:**  Yes, simulated through writing to a temporary file (`./.persistence_demo.txt`) in `setup_persistence_demo()`.  A real version could read/write/delete files anywhere on the system.\n\n\n6. **Network-Related Code:** Yes, simulated through the `connect_c2_demo()` function, which constructs a connection tuple to a hardcoded domain (\"example.com\").\n\n\n7. **Process/Service Manipulation:** No direct manipulation; the demo is commented out.  A malicious version could create processes, escalate privileges, or install services.\n\n\n8. **System Resource Interaction:**  Potentially, through registry access (commented-out code).\n\n\n9. **Obfuscation/Evasion:** Base64 encoding is used for obfuscation.  The anti-VM check is a simple evasion technique.\n\n\n10. **Data Collection/Exfiltration:**  Basic system information is collected.\n\n\n11. **Incomplete/Obfuscated/Misleading Parts:**  The commented-out code in `setup_persistence_demo()` and `connect_c2_demo()` are intentionally misleading, showing what the code *could* do.\n\n\n12. **MITRE ATT&CK Techniques:**\n\n* **T1047.001 (Obfuscated Files or Information):** Base64 encoding.\n* **T1071.001 (Application Layer Protocol):**  Simulated HTTP communication.\n* **T1027.001 (Obfuscated Commands):** Base64-encoded command.\n* **T1547.001 (System Information Discovery):** Collecting system information.\n* **T1543.003 (Create or Modify System Process):** Commented-out registry key creation (persistence).\n* **T1003.001 (System Network Configuration Discovery):** Obtaining system platform information.\n* **T1566.002 (Software Deployment Tools):** Potential use of system tools for malicious purposes.\n\n13. **Overall Risk Rating:** **Medium**.  The code itself is harmless, but its structure and the presence of commented-out malicious code raise concerns.  A malicious version based on this structure could be highly damaging.\n\n\n14. **Recommendations:**\n\n* **Dynamic Analysis:** Run the code (if altered to be malicious) in a sandboxed environment to observe its behavior.\n* **Sandbox Execution:**  Use a sandbox (e.g., Cuckoo Sandbox, Any.run) to analyze the behavior of a potentially modified malicious version.\n* **YARA Rules:** Create YARA rules to detect similar code patterns and base64-encoded strings.\n* **Detection Strategies:** Monitor network traffic, registry changes, and file system activity for suspicious operations.\n\n\n15. **Unintelligible Parts:**  No significant parts were unintelligible. The code is designed to be easily understood.\n\n\n16. **Brief Summary in Points:**\n\n* Safe demo simulating malware techniques.\n* Uses base64 encoding for obfuscation.\n* Includes anti-VM check.\n* Simulates persistence (commented-out registry key creation).\n* Simulates C2 communication.\n* Collects basic system information.\n* Commented-out code reveals potential for malicious activity.\n* Medium risk rating due to simulated malicious activities.\n\n\nThis analysis treats the demo code as if it were malicious;  it is crucial to remember that this specific provided script is benign because of the commenting of potentially dangerous code segments.  Always exercise caution when analyzing unknown code.\n"

    "analysis": "## Malware Code Analysis of demo2.ps1\n\nThis PowerShell script, despite its \"SAFE DEMO\" claim, exhibits several characteristics that would raise red flags in a real-world malware analysis scenario.  The code is designed to *mimic* malicious behavior rather than actually perform it.\n\n**1. Purpose:**\n\nThe script simulates various malware techniques without actually executing malicious actions.  It demonstrates base64 encoding of a URL, simulates anti-VM checks, shows a commented-out persistence mechanism, constructs a network request without sending it, and outputs information about these simulated actions.\n\n**2. Suspicious/Malicious Lines/Functions:**\n\n* **Lines 6-8:** Base64 encoding and decoding of a URL. While not inherently malicious, this is a common obfuscation technique used to hide command and control (C2) server addresses.\n* **Lines 11-17: `Get-AntiVM` function:**  Checks for common virtual machine (VM) processes.  This is a typical anti-analysis technique used by malware to avoid detection in sandboxed environments. Although it doesn't perform any harmful action, its presence is suspicious.\n* **Lines 20-25: `Set-PersistenceDemo` function:** This function contains a commented-out Registry key modification command that would add a persistent entry to the Run key, ensuring the malware restarts with the system.  This is a clear indicator of persistence and a common malware tactic.  The fact that it's commented out doesn't negate its malicious intent.\n* **Lines 28-35: `Invoke-NetworkDemo` function:** This function constructs a URI object from the decoded URL.  While it doesn't make a network connection, the construction of a URI destined for `http://example.com:8080/heartbeat` points towards a potential communication with a C2 server.\n\n**3. Malware Behavior Coding Patterns:**\n\n* **Obfuscation:**  Base64 encoding of the URL.\n* **Anti-analysis:** The `Get-AntiVM` function, although inactive, shows an attempt to evade detection.\n* **Persistence:** The commented-out code in `Set-PersistenceDemo` demonstrates the intent to achieve persistence.\n* **Network communication (potential):**  The `Invoke-NetworkDemo` function suggests a potential C2 communication.\n\n**4. External Libraries, APIs, and System Calls:**\n\n* **`[Convert]::ToBase64String`, `[Convert]::FromBase64String`:** Used for base64 encoding and decoding.  Not inherently suspicious, but often used in malware.\n* **`[Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes`, `[Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetString`:** Used for text encoding and decoding.  Benign functions but used with the obfuscation.\n* **`Get-Process`:**  Used in the `Get-AntiVM` function to retrieve process information â€“ legitimate, but used in a suspicious context.\n* **`reg add` (commented out):**  This Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line (WMIC) command, if uncommented, would modify the registry for persistence.  This is highly suspicious.\n* **`Out-File`:** Writes a file to disk.  Not inherently malicious, but its usage within the `Set-PersistenceDemo` function adds suspicion.\n\n**5. File System Operations:**\n\nYes, the `Set-PersistenceDemo` function (though commented out) attempts to create a file (`$PSScriptRoot\\.persistence_demo.txt`).\n\n**6. Network-Related Code:**\n\nYes, the `Invoke-NetworkDemo` function parses a URL that suggests communication with a remote server (`http://example.com:8080/heartbeat`).  However, no actual network connection is established.\n\n**7. Process/Service Manipulation:**\n\nNo.  The script does not directly manipulate processes or services, although the commented-out `Set-PersistenceDemo` function intends to create a persistent registry entry that would affect process execution on system startup.\n\n**8. System Resource Interaction:**\n\nThe script intends to interact with the registry (commented out), a common target for malware persistence mechanisms.\n\n**9. Obfuscation/Evasion:**\n\nThe base64 encoding of the URL is a clear obfuscation technique. The commented-out registry entry is another layer of obfuscation of intent.\n\n**10. Data Collection/Exfiltration:**\n\nNo explicit data collection or exfiltration is present.\n\n**11. Incomplete/Obfuscated/Misleading Parts:**\n\nThe commented-out code in `Set-PersistenceDemo` is the most significant example of potentially misleading code. The use of the word \"DEMO\" throughout the script is also intended to give the appearance of harmlessness.\n\n**12. MITRE ATT&CK Techniques:**\n\n* **T1070.001 (Indicator Removal on Host):** The `Get-AntiVM` function, while inactive, attempts to detect virtual machine environments, a technique used to evade analysis.\n* **T1547.001 (Boot or Logon Autostart Execution):** The commented-out registry modification code in `Set-PersistenceDemo` aims for persistence through the startup process.\n* **T1041 (Exfiltration Over C2):** The construction of the network request in `Invoke-NetworkDemo`, although inactive, points to a potential C2 communication.\n* **T1027 (Obfuscated Files or Information):**  The use of Base64 encoding to hide the URL.\n\n\n**13. Overall Risk Rating:**\n\n**Medium**. While the code itself does not execute malicious actions, its design and functionality strongly suggest malicious intent.  The commented-out persistence mechanism and the simulated C2 communication are significant indicators.  An uncommented or slightly modified version of this script could be highly dangerous.\n\n**14. Analyst Recommendations:**\n\n* **Dynamic analysis:** Execute the script in a controlled sandbox environment to observe its behavior.\n* **Static analysis:**  Further detailed analysis to look for any additional hidden or obfuscated code.\n* **Behavioral analysis:**  Monitor the script's system calls and network activity using tools such as Process Monitor and Wireshark in the sandboxed environment.\n* **YARA rules:**  Develop YARA rules based on identified characteristics (e.g., base64 encoded strings, specific function names).\n* **Detection strategies:**  Implement security controls to detect registry modifications, network connections to suspicious domains/IPs, and the use of obfuscation techniques.\n\n**15. Unclear/Uninterpretable Parts:**\n\nNo parts of the code are fundamentally uninterpretable. The intentions and potential malicious actions are clear even if not fully executed within this version.\n\n\n**16. Summary in Points:**\n\n* Mimics various malware techniques for demonstration purposes.\n* Contains commented-out persistence mechanism.\n* Uses Base64 encoding for obfuscation.\n* Simulates anti-VM checks.\n* Constructs a network request (without sending it) to a potentially suspicious URL.\n* Overall, presents a medium risk due to clear malicious intent even without execution of actual malicious actions.  The commented code demonstrates potential for highly dangerous behavior if uncommented.\n"
